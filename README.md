# ATBattler

An implementation of a mid-late 1990's "Active-Time Battle" engine, built with HTML5 Canvas.

## Instructions

Currently, ATBattler is a pure-client side implementation with an emulated 'server'.  As such, everything is pretty much hardcoded.

To run, just open client.html in a browser and click the 'start game' button.

Game is mouse-driven for now; keyboard support coming later.

## Browser Support

ATBattler runs on any relatively up-to-date version of Chrome or Firefox.  It also runs in IE9+ (Console must be enabled for now).  It has not been tested in Opera or Safari.
